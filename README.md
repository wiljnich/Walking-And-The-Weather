# Walking And The Weather

Having recently moved to the world of Apple, I was excited to dive into some of the data provided by the Health app. Since returning to graduate school, I've enjoyed the ability to walk more actively than in Boston. In this analysis, I compared the temperature and precipitation of each day I've had my iPhone to determine if I was taking advantage of this opportunity to stay active.

Can I blame it on the **[heat, cold, rain, snow, studying]**? In short, no. Even when controlling for those factors, I found that it was my really active days that kept my less active days in check. There's work left to do, it seems. Back to the trail!
